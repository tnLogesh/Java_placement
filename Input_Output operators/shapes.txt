The three things are in a square shape, rectungalar shape, and circular shape respectively.
Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.
Input format:
First input: a side of a square in integers
Second input: length of a rectangle in integer
Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer
Fourth input: radius of a circle in float
Output format:
The first output should be the area

Program:

import java.util.*;
class Area
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
        int side = s.nextInt() ;
        int length =s.nextInt();
        int breadth=s.nextInt();
        float radius=s.nextFloat();
        System.out.println("area of square "+(side*side));
        System.out.println("area of rect "+(length*breadth));

        System.out.println("area of circle "+(3.14*radius*radius));
    }
}
